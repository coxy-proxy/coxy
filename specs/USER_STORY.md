 # User Story 1: OpenAI-Compatible Proxy Endpoint
 
As a developer using OpenAI-compatible tools, I want to send requests to a proxy server that forwards them to GitHub Copilot so that I can use GitHub Copilot through existing OpenAI-compatible interfaces.
 
 ## Acceptance Criteria (EARS):
 
 - **Given** a valid OpenAI-compatible request, **when** sent to `/chat/completions`, **then** forward to GitHub Copilot API.
 - **Given** an invalid API key, **when** making a request, **then** return `401 Unauthorized`.
 - **Given** a malformed request, **when** sent to the proxy, **then** return `400 Bad Request` with validation errors.
 - **Where** the system acts as a transparent proxy between OpenAI clients and GitHub Copilot.

 # User Story 2: Admin Dashboard
 
 As a system administrator, I want an admin interface to monitor and configure the proxy so that I can manage API usage, view logs, and configure settings.
 
 ## Acceptance Criteria (EARS):
 
 - **Given** admin credentials, **when** accessing `/admin`, **then** display dashboard with usage statistics.
 - **Given** proxy requests, **when** they occur, **then** log them for admin review.
 - **Given** configuration changes, **when** submitted through admin panel, **then** update proxy behavior.
 - **Where** admin access is protected by authentication.


# User Story 3: API Key Management

As a system administrator I want to manage API keys for proxy access so that I can control who can use the proxy service

## Acceptance Criteria (EARS):

- **Given** admin access, **when** creating API keys, **then** generate secure tokens for client access
- **Given** an API key, **when** used in requests, **then** validate and track usage
- **Given** admin access, **when** viewing API keys, **then** show usage statistics and status
